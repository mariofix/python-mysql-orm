# Python Mysql Active Record

This is an activerecord module inspired from CodeIgniter activerecord and database driver library.

Use it to integrate a activerecord mysql database into your python application.

You can interact with the database using many of the active record functions that CodeIgniter provides.

##usage
run as a console or import it as a module

* 1.first of all, you have to configure your database in config.py
* 2.1 import the database module then follow the step3 and step4
* 2.2 or just run database.py as a console then follow step4
* 3.make a instance of the class to initialize a database connection: db = Database()
* 4.call functions just like we do in codeigniter

##notice
the function from() in ci is renamed to table() for avoiding compatible problem , it is a key word in python

##examples
you can put them in your py codes or type them in the console(run database.py directly)

	dating_target = db.table('employee').select('firstname, lastname, email, mobile').where('age <', 25).where('gender', 'female').order_by('age', 'asc').limit(10, 20).get().reulst()
	print dating_target
	
or like this

	db.talbe('employee')
	db.where({'firstname':'Paul', 'age >': 28, })
	db.get()
	print db.row()
